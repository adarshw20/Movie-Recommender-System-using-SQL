## üéØ Project Goals

- **Learn SQL Fundamentals**: Master basic SQL queries through hands-on practice
- **Real Dataset Analysis**: Work with realistic movie data including titles, genres, and ratings
- **Interactive Learning**: Execute queries instantly and see results in real-time
- **Beginner-Friendly**: No complex SQL features - focus on core concepts
- **Export Capabilities**: Download query results as CSV files for further analysis

## üóÇÔ∏è Database Schema

The project uses a simple 3-table SQLite database:

### 1. `movies` Table
| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| movie_id | INTEGER | Primary key |
| title | TEXT | Movie title |
| year | INTEGER | Release year |
| language | TEXT | Primary language |
| duration | INTEGER | Runtime in minutes |

### 2. `genres` Table
| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| movie_id | INTEGER | Foreign key to movies |
| genre | TEXT | Genre name (Sci-Fi, Action, etc.) |

### 3. `ratings` Table
| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| rating_id | INTEGER | Primary key |
| movie_id | INTEGER | Foreign key to movies |
| user_id | INTEGER | User identifier |
| rating | REAL | Rating score (0-10) |

## üîß Featured SQL Queries

### Beginner Level
- **List All Movies**: Basic SELECT statement
- **Find Sci-Fi Movies**: Simple JOIN with WHERE clause
- **Movies After 2010**: Date filtering with WHERE
- **Long Movies by Language**: Multi-condition filtering

### Intermediate Level
- **Average Rating per Movie**: JOIN with AVG aggregation
- **Top 5 Highest-Rated Movies**: Complex query with LIMIT
- **Movies by Genre Count**: GROUP BY with COUNT

### Advanced Level
- **Genre Distribution Analysis**: Advanced aggregation with percentage calculations

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

- See the exact SQL that was executed

### 5. Dataset Statistics
The Stats Panel shows:
- Total movies and genres in database
- Average rating across all movies
- Most popular genre
- Newest/oldest movies
- Longest/shortest movies

## üìä Sample Data

The project includes 15 popular movies with realistic data:
